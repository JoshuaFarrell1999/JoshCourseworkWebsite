    <div class="content-area1"><p>Hello, my name is Joshua Farrell, I’m 19 years old, and before I came to Code Nation I studied History, Classics and Ancient History at A-Level, which was fun at the time, but it became increasingly clear that the job prospects these courses provided were very, very sparse. I spent a long time looking for work, eventually spending a few months moving trolleys as an agency worker for Muller. In the months leading up to Christmas, I stopped getting calls, so I went back to the jobcentre to try and find something else. <br>I met Ezra in a youth workshop, and the prospect of learning a trade so highly in demand was tantalising. That’s even without taking into account my affinity for technology and tinkering, which only helped to draw me in faster. 
    <br>When I arrived here, I was blown away by how open and friendly everyone was. The facilities and provisions are amazing, the staff are helpful and the location is as close to ideal as you can get. From my time here, I’ve been shown Python, HTML and CSS, and I’ve both taken to it strongly and enjoyed the learning process immeasurably. <br>This experience has opened my eyes to a whole new sector of work I’d be happy to dive into, and for the first time in years, I’m happy to get up in the morning, which has to count for something.
