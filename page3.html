        <p><b>1.1:</b>
            <br>
            Every page of my website has a fixed horizontal banner and a vertical navigation bar, with around a fifth of the screen dedicated to this format to better frame the page. The top banner gives my name, and suggests visiting my social media accounts, icons are laid out in the left and right corner which act as links to my account on the appropriate platform. The navigation bar lists the home menu, unit 1, unit 2, and my review page in descending order. My home page contains my introduction outlying my history, my drive, and my experience at Code Nation. Unit 1 contains all of my answers to unit 1 outcome 1 and 2. Unit 2 contains my answers to unit 2 outcome 1. Review contains my answer to unit 1 outcome 3.</p>

        <p><b>1.5: Describing copyright and other constraints
            affecting websites </b>
            <br>
            Copyright in regards to websites is created at the time of development, effectively meaning that the material displayed on the website is not to be used without the permission of the owner. As of 1989, a public display of a copyright is not required to have a copyright take effect. In the UK, it costs £42.50 for 5 years or £72.50 for 10 years of copyright protection. Alongside this fee, you must send in a non-returnable deposit. This deposit contains the material you wish to copyright. This means that any updates to the website after the copyright is secured will require an updated claim with a new fee.<a href="https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/services/price_list"target=blank class="cit">[15]</a><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/what-it-means-to-copyright-a-website/"target=blank class="cit">[16]</a> The GDPR affects the handling of user data, and any goods sold on websites must obey laws regarding general commerce.</p>
        
            <p><b>1.6:  Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</b>
            <br>
            The issue that requires the least technical knowledge to resolve is to improve accessibility for those with partial or full colour blindness, as all it requires is to avoid putting colours such as blue, green and yellow near each other. For more general colour accessibility, I will use white text on a black background due to personal preference, though the ability to include a light mode with the colour palette swapped will be taken into consideration. 
            <br>
            Text to speech can be used to aid the visually impaired, with alt tags on all images so the text-to-speech can describe the image. Subtitles should be available for any videos and transcripts for sound files to prevent the hearing impaired from missing out on any features of my website. For those with motor control issues, the clickable range of links can be increased to make it less difficult to click with a mouse.<a href="https://mashable.com/2014/04/22/website-disability-friendly/?europe=true"target=blank class="cit">[17]</a></p>

            <p><b>1.7: Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</b>
            <br>
            HTML is described as the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of Web content by using <tags> to change the format of the page and create hyperlinks to other pages.<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"target=blank class="cit">[18]</a> CSS is a language used to control the style and feel of the content written in HTML. It does this by creating rules and applying them to various elements in the website. It works by attaching .css commands to HTML tags to change their visual properties.<a href="https://www.purelybranded.com/notes/why-use-css-in-website-design/"target=blank class="cit">[19]</a> JS is a language that-when used in the context of Web design-allows us to make changes to how certain features on a website function, enabling more advanced prompts such as checkboxes and calls-to-action with .js commands.<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-html-css-javascript"target=blank class="cit">[20]</a></p>
