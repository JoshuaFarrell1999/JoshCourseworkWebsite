        <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h2>
        <br>
        <p><b>3.1:</b> 
            My planning was thorough in regards to outlining what had to be done, however some time could have been delegated to researching the methods of how I would accomplish each task to save time overall, perhaps by marking aside 2-3 hours of research and development time at the start rather than simply bludgeoning each problem one by one. This was not a failure of Trello, so I cannot throw this oversight at its feet. 
            In fact, all of my tools increased my productivity immensely, it was merely my own inefficiency which hampered the end product. I am still confident in the merits of what I have done however, as there are only one or two features missing; consequently I can say that only hindsight could have improved my performance.</p>
            <br>
             <p><b>3.2:</b>
             <br>
            The most common cause of a drop in productivity is dehydration, as it will massively hamper your cognitive functions, tanking your work rate. I managed this well, as I regularly drank while working. I could have personally taken a break at around 15:30, as I noticed my concentration begin to waver around this time, but quite often I would soldier on, as I was anxious about the approaching deadline. This is the only real change I would have made to my habits while working.</p>
            <br>
             <p><b>3.3:</b>
             <br>
            My personal routine for working was quite sound, however I expect that if I wanted the project done faster, working with others will almost always result in a quicker result. I would use Slack to maintain communications with my team without having to constantly check up on them, but I would not use Slack for code sharing at all, as I have learned from previous experiences that code can quite easily get lost in a tirade of shared code with fairly similar titles. As such, I would instead rely on GitHub, due to its fork/pull/merge features which provide an easy method of integrating different lines of code while also serving as both storage and a tool for version control.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>3.4:</b>
            <br>
            Code usually fails in two different ways, one way being much more desirable than the other. The first is that the code simply refuses to work, this will usually be a syntax or formatting error, perhaps you didn’t input an existing command, or maybe you just misspelled something. This is the preferred result, as VS Code’s terminal will usually point out where the error occurred, and you have to change whatever is failing until it works. If you don’t know why it is failing then it could take a while but it is still far easier than the other outcome.
            <br>
            The second outcome is where the real time sink is located. Here, the code works, it just does something completely different to what you expected. In this instance, you are not afforded the luxury of a terminal to check for errors, because the program thinks everything is correct. Here, you have to break down what every line of code is doing in relation to all the other code, then check if the format is warping what the code is doing, only to find the issue in the most remote of interactions between a HTML tag you forgot to remove and a conflicting CSS command.</p>
