        <p><b>1.1:  Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </b>
            <br>
            Information Technology has-in recent years-become absolutely inseparable from a modern business. It provides a quick and reliable hub for interpersonal communications, a method for far-reaching advertisement, and acts as a great boost to employee productivity through modern innovations such as cloud storage or older features like Microsoft Office which both save time (thanks to the greater computing power of these programs) space (due to the comparative lack of physical documents due to the digital storage hard drives and servers offer) and, consequently, a lot of money.<a href="https://www.oksbdc.org/why-is-technology-important-in-business/"target=blank class="cit">[1]</a><a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/information-technology-its-role-modern-organization-1800.html"target=blank class="cit">[2]</a>
            <br>
            As a result, IT staff have become some of the most essential staff in a business, if a server stops running or the Internet in a building ceases to function, the whole office building will grind to a halt.     <a href="https://www.south.edu/blog/importance-information-technology-business/"target=blank class="cit">[3]</a>
     They are well worth the cost, however, as in order to stay competitive on the market, they need the best tools technology can provide, because innovation creates market leaders, and market leaders make a lot of money.<a href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380"target=blank class="cit">[4]</a>
            <br>
            Assuming hypothetically that a business were to go completely analogue and divorce themselves from any advancement provided in the last 40 years, they would require all communications to be done by telephone or in person, the physical storage space required in every office would multiply tenfold, the work rate would plummet, documents would disappear, lost in the mountain of other written files. Such a business would effectively be inducing a state of torpor upon itself of its own volition. It would collapse in months or never even get off the ground assuming it was just starting up.   <a href="https://techedgeservices.com/2018/04/09/could-your-business-run-without-technology/"target=blank class="cit">[5]</a></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>1.2:  Describing methods, skills and resources
            needed to complete digital projects successfully –
            what do you need to make projects successful?
            What tools? What skills?</b>
            <br>
            The primary method I’ve been acquainted with for the successful completion of tasks is the concept of kanban. In effect, it allows you to organise your tasks in a manner that helps identify bottlenecks in your progress, resulting in a streamlined production process.        <a href="https://www.digite.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/"target=blank class="cit">[6]</a>Kanban paired with Trello (a website which allows you to create a to-do list and divide tasks into named columns (eg. to-do, doing and done) which you can use to place and relocate your tasks to visually assess your progress) sets out a solid method for attacking any goal anyone sets out for you. Trello allows you to make checklists, attach files, add details on tasks, comment on tasks, and even share the board between colleagues for group projects. 
            <br>
            Slack is a useful application for sharing code and networking between teammates, however for access to a greater pool of coding knowledge, GitHub appears to be the best choice on offer, as it allows for other coders to offer edits on code you upload but don’t provide write access for by first “forking” your code and then sending a “pull” request, which gives the original coder the opportunity to test the new code and decide whether to merge it with his base code.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/"target=blank class="cit">[7]</a> This has the potential to greatly expedite solutions to issues that could potentially take me a great deal of time to find on my own.
            <br>
            These tools and methods could save me a lot of time, but I must have the time management required to effectively timeline a production cycle, the wherewithal to recognise any emerging issues and the initiative to stamp them out before they grow into something that could threaten the completion of my project. Especially when working alone, where I must become my own project manager. <a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/project-management-skills"target=blank class="cit">[8]</a></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>1.3: Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</b> 
            <br>
            I intend to first outline my objectives on a To-Do list, each with a description of what I need to do and a checklist to further break down the process, making it easily digestible and to the point. This provides me a clear guide, while providing enough wiggle room to make creative decisions during the production process; allowing me to work in a manner which provides the structure of a rigid routine, while preserving all the liberating benefits of freeform work.
            <br>
            Any post-draft changes will be listed first, then edited to ensure all the necessary tweaks are made, otherwise I would run the risk of forgetting and leaving in simple mistakes or omitting important features I missed in the first draft.<a href="https://trello.com/b/UvcERUk8/website"target=blank class="cit">[9]</a></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>1.4: Describe the risks that might impact digital
                projects – what causes digital projects to fail?
                Why?</b>
            <br>
            Any digital project will be susceptible to being overly-ambitious with the initial goals set out by the team. This is dangerous because exorbitant amounts of time will inevitably be spent trying to implement ideas beyond the abilities of the team.
            <br>
            On the other end of the spectrum, a lack of organisation and foresight can result in feature creep, which can massively delay projects and create ballooning budgets for little gain, as feature creep often leads to a poor user experience as they are drowned in features they never needed or asked for. <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/feature-creep-the-bane-of-our-existence"target=blank class="cit">[10]</a></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>1.5: Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</b>
            <br>
            The first thing you do when selecting software for a task is to decide what it is you want to do, then check if the software can do it. Next, you check to see if the software is user-friendly. There is no point in picking a program if it is too cumbersome or inefficient. The best way to check this is to look online.<a href="https://www.middlestone.ltd/blog/steps-to-choosing-software-that-is-right-for-your-small-business"target=blank class="cit">[11]</a>
            <br>
            For example, for general editing, I have been using Microsoft Visual Studio Code, as it is the most highly rated tool by developers in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, with over 50% of those surveyed declaring it their most used program.<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#methodology" class="cit">[12]</a></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>1.6: Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</b>
            <br>
            Trello Has given me a platform to properly organise my development process, with an extremely user friendly UI and a lot of convenient features such as checklists, deadlines and progress columns which help keep me on track to achieve my targets. GitHub provides a hub for all versions of my code, which is easy to navigate, making version control (the process of saving many versions of the same piece of code to compare changes) a much simpler task than organising it myself, due to the cloud storage of my code.<a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html"target=blank class="cit">[13]</a></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>1.7: Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</b>
            <br>
            Legal constraints are a primary concern for digital projects, as not obeying these constraints would result in a criminal investigation, prosecution, and likely the termination of the project. The GDPR in particular applies to projects which collect data for online marketing or dealing personal data. Effectively, the GDPR means that you must have the consent of the user to store data, that it must be used for relevant services, and that it must be deleted after its period of usefulness has expired. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation"target=blank class="cit">[14]</a>
